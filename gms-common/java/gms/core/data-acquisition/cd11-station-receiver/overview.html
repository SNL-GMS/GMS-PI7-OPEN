<h1>Overview of the Station Receiver Module</h1>
<h2>Connection Manager (ConnMan)</h2>
<p>
ConnMan is responsible for listening for CD-1.1 Connection Requests on the
'well-known port', deciding whether to respond, and sending back
CD-1.1 Connection Response frames that specify an address and port to begin
streaming data to.  The address it sends should be the one that DataMan expects,
so both ConnMan and DataMan need to share this configuration.
</p>
<h2>Data Manager (DataMan)</h2>
<p>
  DataMan listens to the streaming data received from Station's in the CD-1.1
  protocol once a connection has been established.  It does not handle connection
  negotiation (this is the role of ConnMan); it's job is to listen on all configured IP
  addresses and ports to receive data from specified Station's.  It takes this data, parses
  and verifies it,
  logs information about it, and stores it by uploading to the OSD Gateway Service OSD.
