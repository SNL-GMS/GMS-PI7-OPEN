<h1>Overview of the Object Storage Distribution (OSD) Module</h1>
<p>A central component of the GMS System is the persistent storage of an extensive history of sensor
  and station data, station configuration data, significant signal detections and events.
  In previous versions of the system access to the data was achieved by directly interacting with
  the RDBMS query language.  This direct form of access resulted in strong dependencies between the
  application software and tools and the database structure, resulting in significant impact when
  modifying or expanding the underlying database schema.  A design goal for the modernized system
  is to isolate the application software from the underlying database schema and data storage
  technology to limit the impact of changing the database structure and implementation.
</p>
<p>This isolation will be achieved through a mechanism called the Object Storage and Distribution
  Mechanism or OSD.  The OSD will be responsible for persisting and retrieving data in the System.
  The OSD will be responsible for translating the data calls into
  queries on the underlying data storage technologies, integrating results if the query required
  data from multiple data stores, and returning results.  The definition of the query interface
  to the persisted data and associated data class definitions is described in the Common Object
  Interface (COI).
