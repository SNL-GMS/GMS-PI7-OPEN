# Default configuration settings
# The application uses the config npm library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/config)
# These settings are overridden by settings in the other configuration json files (e.g. production, test)
# All file-base settings can be overridden by command-line arguments and environment variables
# See the config library documentation for details

# Overall variable to coordinate use of backend (mock) or OSD data
# each config (station, qcMask...) have their own variable that uses this value by default
